# multimodal_stimuli_emotion_paradigm
This is a code for running Presentation NBS based experimental paradigm with short movie clips, music clips and static pictures.
There are 3 sessions (scenarios) each with 5 movie clips, 5 music clips and 5 blocks of 8 pictures. Overall there are 15 unique movie clips, 12 unique music clips and 100 pictures. Movie clips were from hollywood movies which are available on request. They were rated for their  valence and arousal in pilot testing. Music clips were taken from a previous study (Eerola and Vuoskoski 2011). Static pictures were taken  from IAPS (Lang, Bradley et al. 1997). Movie clips are not uploaded but can be requested as they may be subject to copyright issues. Music clips and static pictures have been uploaded. Further details of the paradigm can be obtained from the paper (Sonkusare et al., 2020) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2020.05.018.

Note: git somehow restricts uploading more than 100 files in a folder so there are two folders with stimuli
